<em> and <strong> — Emphasis.
    By default, text inside <em> is displayed as italic, and text in <strong> is displayed as boldface.
    <p> — Paragraph.
    Text in a paragraph is separated visually from other paragraphs by a small margin.
    <br> — Line break. (empty)
    A line break does not create a new paragraph; it only marks the end of a line.
    <sub> and <sup> — Subscript and superscript.
    Useful for math and chemistry: I have x3+2x2 molecules of H2O.
    <mark> — Highlighting.
    Not very often used, but it's kind of cool.
